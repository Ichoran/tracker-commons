# Python implementation of Tracker Commons

This project contains source code in Python that implements the WCON data
format for tracking data.  When the Python specification and the behavior of
the Scala implementation differ, and it is not obvious which one is correct,
the behavior of the Scala implementation should be presumed to be authoritative.
